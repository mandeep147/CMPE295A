# Events in the city   

### Motive:
Staying updated about upcoming events is quite difficult these days as there is no single platform to check all the events at the same time. 
Many events taking place in various domains like movies, games, hackathons, tech talks, etc., in and around the city goes unnoticed as there is no single platform for all the events mentioned. 
Due to lack of information, people tend to miss the important events which might take place in their neighborhood.

In this project, we, in a team of 4, extracted and retrieve local events from different web pages and social media websites like Meetup, Eventbrite using webscraping and Develpoer APIs. 
We gathered structured information related to the events that include the event name, time, place prominently and other relative information like price, reviews etc. 

Since target audience is students and/or people living in Bay Area and Sillicon Valley     
  * Events include mainly Technical and Recreational(outdoor activities and concerts) Events
